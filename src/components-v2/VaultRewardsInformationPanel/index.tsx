				<Typography className={classes.description}>
					Stacking Bitcoin is a priority for many people in our community. These vaults sell all of the

					earns even more Bitcoin by autocompounding its own rewards.

				<Typography variant="body1" className={classes.name}>
					Ecosystem Rewards:
				</Typography>
				<Typography className={classes.description}>
					Many of the DeFi platforms that Badger vaults interact with give rewards in the form of tokens that
					have utility within their ecosystem. Depositors who want to accumulate these tokens may want to
					consider Ecosystem Rewards vaults. Each token is distributed as an associated Ecosystem Helper
					vault, which optimally handles the token for you while earning even more rewards.
				</Typography>
				<Typography variant="body1" className={classes.name}>
					Ecosystem Helper:
				</Typography>
				<Typography className={classes.description}>
					The tokens earned by Ecosystem Rewards vaults have the ability to earn additional rewards, provided
					that they are deployed productively. Ecosystem Helper vaults automate this process for you,
					eliminating the complexity and cost of doing it yourself.
